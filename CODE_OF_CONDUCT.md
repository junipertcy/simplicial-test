# Code of Conduct

We aspire to make academia a more diverse and inclusive place. We value friendly and constructive discussions.

We abide by the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/), which covers all the infrastructure used in the development of `Simplicial-test` (e.g., issue trackers, GitHub discussions, mailing lists, etc.).

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be **open**, **considerate**, and **respectful** of others.
